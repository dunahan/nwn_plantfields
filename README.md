Description<br />
I wanted to put some scripts together so I could help rebuild an area devastated by war for a persistant world project.<br />
This basic one helps a farmer by preparing, then planting a small field.<br /><br />

As on [Neverwinter Vault](https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/prefab/plantable-fields) <br />

---

As given above, I want to add/improve somethings here and there.<br />
Planned:
- [ ] Allow planting on grassland (and more), not only on the given tile in the demo.
- [ ] Change the previous tools from weapons to items.
- [ ] Add obstacles, that need to be removed first.
- [ ] Simplify the placement of plantable areas, not by drawing triggers.
- [ ] ...
